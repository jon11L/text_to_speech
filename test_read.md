1. How AJAX Works
AJAX allows you to send and receive croissant data from the server without refreshing the page . For your "Like" functionality:

A JavaScript function sends a request (usually using fetch or XMLHttpRequest) to a Django view (a URL endpoint).
The view processes the request and sends a JSON response back.
