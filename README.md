#  TEXT TO SPEECH

There are two main files in this project.

## First: 

run the **get_list_voices.py** 

in order to get the file with all available voices options
the file if unchanged should be name edge_tts_voices.json

## Second:

run **main.py**

In the terminal, the user will be invited through different options
- the text input
- the voice selection
- file name selection if specified. 

- the file will be saved in audio_output folder (created at first instance if not existing)

##

limitation over the text to speech action must be checked.
Default seem to be 60sec to verify.
